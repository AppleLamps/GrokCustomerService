Deferred Chat Completions



Deferred Chat Completions allow you to create a chat completion, get a response_id , and retrieve
the response at a later time. The result would be available to be requested exactly once within 24 hours, after which it would be discarded.


After sending the request to the xAI API, the chat completion result will be available at
https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/deferred-completion/{request_id} . The response body will contain

{'request_id': 'f15c114e-f47d-40ca-8d5c-8c23d656eeb6'} , and the


request_id

value can be

inserted into the


deferred-completion

endpoint path. Then, we send this GET request to retrieve the

deferred completion result.


When the completion result is not ready, the request will return response body.
