Reasoning
Grok 3 Mini is a lightweight, smaller thinking model. Unlike traditional models that generate answers immediately, Grok 3 Mini thinks before responding. It's ideal for reasoning-heavy tasks that don't demand extensive domain knowledge, and shines in math-specific and quantitative use cases, such as solving challenging puzzles or math problems.



Key Features

Think Before Responding: Thinks through problems step-by-step before delivering an answer. Math & Quantitative Strength: Excels at numerical challenges and logic puzzles.

Reasoning Trace: The model's thoughts are available via the response completion object (see example below).

reasoning_content

field in the





Control how hard the model thinks


The


reasoning_effort

parameter controls how much time the model spends thinking before

responding. It must be set to one of these values:

low : Minimal thinking time, using fewer tokens for quick responses.
high : Maximum thinking time, leveraging more tokens for complex problems.


Choosing the right level depends on your task: use


low

for simple queries that should complete

quickly, and


high

for harder problems where response latency is less important.



Usage Example

Here's a simple example using Grok 3 Mini to multiply 101 by 3. Notice that we can access both the reasoning content and final response.

When to Use Reasoning


Use

grok-3-mini-beta or

grok-3-mini-fast-beta : For tasks that can benefit from logical

reasoning (such as meeting scheduling or math problems). Also great for tasks that don't require deep domain knowledge about a specific subject (eg basic customer support bot).

Use

grok-3-beta or

grok-3-fast-beta : For queries requiring deep domain expertise or world

knowledge (eg healthcare, legal, finance).
