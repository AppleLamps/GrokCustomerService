Getting Started
Get $150 in free API credits each month
xAI is offering $150 per month in free API credits for teams that opt in to data sharing (available in eligible countries*). By opting in, you agree to share your API requests with xAI.

To qualify for free credits, your team must have already spent a minimum of $5 on the API before choosing to opt in.


How it works


Data sharing is set at the team level.
You can have multiple teams-some opted in, others not. Only team admins can enable data sharing.
To opt in, go to the Credits Section on the xAI API Console Billing page. After a team has chosen to opt-in to data sharing, the team cannot opt-out.



To check if you're eligible to participate in the free credits program, go to the cloud console:
